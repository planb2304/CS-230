Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
They were creating a game that would run on all major OSs and they needed help deciding how to host the game in the most efficient way.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think that I was very thorough in describing the pros and cons of the different server platforms. I offered advice on which platform would be best for the scope of their project.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was helpful to put the processes of the app into plain english. I found that I had a better understanding of what I needed to do after writing out the design document. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe that I could have been more clear when describing how the different servers functioned. After looking back over it, I don't believe that someone without developing experience would be able to understand my descriptions. In the future I will work on making my documents more accessible to laymen.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I considered how much storage would be needed for the application and how to easily allow different devices to communicate with it. It is extremely important to consider what the user needs, because the user experience is one of the key factors in an applications success.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I considered what the client needed the application to do, and how to most effeciently achieve that. I believe that this strategy is key to successfly developing an application.
